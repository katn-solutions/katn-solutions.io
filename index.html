                        <p>Custom linter development including <strong>namedreturns</strong> (github.com/nikogura/namedreturns) enforcing self-documenting code. Named return values make function signatures explicit about what they return, improving readability and reducing errors.</p>

                    <p><strong>Clear is better than clever.</strong> Code should be boring, predictable, and maintainable. Linters enforce discipline that prevents entire classes of bugs and security vulnerabilities. When the linter complains, the code is wrong - not the linter.</p>
                    <p><strong>Standards adopted org-wide.</strong> From enterprise to startups, KATN Solutions establishes engineering standards that teams embrace because they prevent problems rather than create bureaucracy.</p>
